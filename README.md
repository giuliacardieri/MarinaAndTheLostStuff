# Marina And The Lost Stuff
##What?
Marina And The Lost Stuff is a game created as a gift to my digital secret santa.
It's a simple game developed with HTML5, CSS3 and jQuery.

##I don't know how to play! What should I do?
In order to win you must click over the items that belongs to Marina. If you don't know her it's probably not gonna make much sense, but I still think you should play :D
